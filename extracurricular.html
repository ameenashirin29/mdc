      <h2><p style="color:#ff0000;">What I Do Beyond Academics</p></h2>
      <p>I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between academics and extra-curricular activities. Over the years, I have participated in a variety of activities that have helped me develop new skills, foster teamwork, and contribute to my community. Here are some of the key areas where I've been actively involved:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Sports</em>:</strong> I have actively participated in inter-school football and basketball tournaments, honing my teamwork and leadership skills.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Music</em>:</strong> I play the violin and have been part of a local music group where we perform at community events.</li>
        <li><strong><em>kalari</em>:</strong> I have been practicing kalari for the past 4 years.</li>
       
        <li><strong><em>Gym</em>:</strong> i am very conscious about my health and body and i love spending time in gym.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>These activities have played a significant role in shaping my personality and preparing me for various challenges in life.</p><br>
